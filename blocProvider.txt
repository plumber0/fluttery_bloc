BlocProvider will provide a single instance of a bloc to the subtree below it.

Dependency Injection

sub widget can access via

BlocProvider.of<BlocA>(context);

context.bloc<BlocA>();

By default, BlocProvider creates the bloc lazily

BlocProvider handles the closing part of blocs automatically

///
BlocProvider.value(
    value: BlocProvider.of<BlocA>(context),
    child: AnotherUsefulScreen(),
)

provides the only instance of blocA to the new portion of the tree


Since the only instance of BlocA was created with BlocProvider, it will get automatically closed by the BlocProvider
